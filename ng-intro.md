#Prereading Highlights

[Angular Guide Introduction](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/introduction
)

* A "framework for dynamic web apps"
* "Lets you use HTML as your template language"
* Will "extend HTML's syntax"
* "Handles all of the DOM and AJAX glue code you once wrote by hand and puts it in a well-defined structure"
* Is "opinionated about how a CRUD application should be built"
* Comes with "Data-binding, basic templating directives, form validation, routing, deep-linking, reusable components and dependency injection"
* "Angular simplifies application development by presenting a higher level of abstraction to the developer"
* "Not every app is a good fit for Angular. Angular was built with the CRUD application in mind."
* "Angular is built around the belief that declarative code is better than imperative when it comes to building UIs and wiring software components together, while imperative code is excellent for expressing business logic."

##HTML Setup

Head to [jsbin](http://jsbin.com/) and setup a new workspace.

Add Angular 1.4 to the project with the `Add Library` button

In your HTML try changing the `<body>` to `<body ng-app>`. This will tell your HTML page to use use Angular.

Let's name our app `ngFun`. To do this we can create an empty angular module.

```js
var app = angular.module("ngFun", []);
```

Now update your `body` element to `<body ng-app="ngFun">`.

Sweet we're up and running!

##Templates & Expressions

Angular creates it's views by templating directly into HTML with expressions. This is it's declarative way of building the UI.

Try writing any regular javascript expression in side double curly brackets, such as: `{{ <expression> }}` and see what your HTML evaluates to. What happens what you express:

* `4 * 4`
* `"hola!".toUpperCase()`
* `['s','w','e','e','t','n','e','s','s'].join("")`

##Controllers & Scope

Controllers contain all the business logic for our application.

We can seed our application with some data, but first we have to create a controller.

```js
app.controller("PokemonCtrl", function() {
	//logic here
});
```

Most applications will have several controllers that map to a particular resource. In this case we're using Pokemon.

To use our controller somewhere in our View we have to declare it. Create a new `div` tag that will house our Pokemon Controller.

```html
<div ng-controller="PokemonCtrl">
	<!--placeholder for now-->
</div>
```

In order to pass data or behavior to our HTMl view we need to use the object `$scope`. It is the interface to pass data and behavior into our views. Both the View and Controller share access to the $scope object.

![scope](http://devgirl.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/concepts-controller.png)

Let's register some Pokemon with $scope!

```js
app.controller("PokemonCtrl", function($scope){
  $scope.pokemon = [
    {
      Ndex: 25,
      name: 'Pikachu',
      type: 'Electric'
    },
    {
      Ndex: 10,
      name: 'Caterpie',
      type: 'Bug'
    },
    {
      Ndex: 39,
      name: 'Jigglypuff',
      type: 'Fairy'
    },
    {
      Ndex: 94,
       name: 'Gengar',
      type: 'Ghost'
    },
    {
      Ndex: 143,
      name: 'Snorlax',
      type: 'Normal'
    }
  ];
});
```

Great, now let's see if we can see them in our view by referencing the `pokemon` variable inside an expression and wrapping it in a `pre` tag.

```html
<div ng-controller="PokemonCtrl">
	<pre>{{ pokemon }}</pre>
</div>
```

That's cool, but it doesn't look very great. What if we could format our data so that the View knows to render it as JSON?

###Challenge

* Use an Angular [filter](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/filter) to render the data as JSON! Here are a [list](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/filter) of options you can implement.

* Pass a new variable `catchphrase` from the Controller to the View. Set it's value as "gotta catch 'em all!" and use an angular filter to uppercase it in the View.


##[Directives](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/directive)

In Angular, we add behavior to HTML through directives. A directive is a marker on a HTML tag that tells Angular to run or reference Angular code. You've already used several!

Angular directives start with the prefix `ng-`

A few we already know:

`ng-app` turns ordinary HTML into an Angular application.

`ng-controller` registers a controller for a section of our application.

A few worth introducing:

`ng-model` binds an HTML element's value to a model.

`ng-repeat` iterates over a collection.


###ng-Model

Our user wants to be able to input their name in a field, so that the application acknowledges them as the trainer for these Pokemon.

Above our list of Pokemon, but still inside our `PokemonCtrl` `div` tag, let's create an input field for our trainers name.

```html
  <div ng-controller="PokemonCtrl">
  
    <span>Enter your name:</span>
    <input/>
    
    <pre>{{ pokemon | json }}</pre>
    
  </div>
```

If we want our input field to map its value to an attribute `name` on a `trainer` object we could add an `ng-model` directive to it.

```html
<input ng-model="trainer.name"/>
```

Additionally if we want the value of the `trainer.name` variable to be printed onto our page in an `h1` tag, we can reference it in an expression, such that our HTML looks like:

```html
  <div ng-controller="PokemonCtrl">
  
    <h1>Trainer: {{trainer.name}}</h1>
    
    <span>Enter your name:</span>
    <input ng-model="trainer"/>
    
    <pre>{{ pokemon | json }}</pre>
    
  </div>
```


###Challenge

* How could we create a default value for the trainer's name so that when the page loads it is set to `Ash`?

###ng-repeat

`ngRepeat` is a very useful directive for rendering a collection while writing a minimal amount of HTML.

###Challenge

Rendering the JSON Pokemon in a bootstrap table, where each attribute is a column. The final result should look like this:

![pokemon-table](http://i.imgur.com/or1CwF7.png)

Hint: add bootstrap into your project by clicking `Add Library`

###etc

There are many more directives. For now, know that they exist and why they may be useful. Beyond that, reference the documentation. You can find a comprehensive list [here](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive). By now you should know that memorizing each by heart is a fruitless exercise.


###Challenge

* Sort the Pokemon by nDex number.
* Create an input tag so that I can search for a particular Pokemon.

##Custom Filters

We've been notified that there is a new set of Pokemon in an alternate universe consisting of arch-nemeses. Pikachu's arch nemesis is Uhcakip, while Snorlax's is Xalrons. Let's construct a table that displays all the arch-nemeses.

Angular doesn't have a `reverse` filter, so let's create one.

```js
app.filter('reverse', function() {
  return function(items) {
    return items.slice().reverse();
  };
});
```

###Challenge

* Create a new table of Pokemon with the names reversed representing their arch nemeses.

##Pro-tip: Minification in Angular

Remember the main goal in [minification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming)) is to save space and deliver the file quickly. A variable `myVariableName` may be renamed to `A` during minification. A computer doesn't care what the name is as long as they are consistent.

If you ever minify your angular code when delivering it to a client your variables will be renamed and this may cause problems. We're used to seeing code like this.

```js
app.controller("PokemonCtrl", function() {
  
});
```

To allow minifiers to rename the function parameters and still be able to inject the right services, we need to explicitly `$inject` the arguments we want into our controller.

```js
var PokemonCtrl = function($scope, $http) {
  
};
PokemonCtrl.$inject = ['$scope', '$http'];
app.controller('PokemonCtrl', PokemonCtrl);
```

or we can pass our controller an array that contains an array of our dependencies and a function, whose arguments have a 1 to 1 correspondence to the previous items.

```js
app.controller('PokemonCtrl', ['$scope', '$http', function($scope, $http) {
  
}]);
```

While our arguments will get minified, the strings will not. The names of arguments are significant, because the injector uses these to look up the dependencies.

This is one of the worst, most confusing parts of Angular. Hang in there!
